This GitHub contains the code for my final project for Intro to Computer Science. 
The folder titled Minesweeper contains 4 different things.
- A folder titled imaages that contain all of the assets that are needed for the minesweeper game
- A python file titled SetUp used for loading all of the assets and defining game parameters
- A python file titled Sprites used for defining and coding the sprites and functions that are used in minesweeper
- A python notebook file titled Final Project. This file imports the other two files into itself and uses them to actually run the minesweeper game
